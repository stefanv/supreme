Guidelines for Use of NASA Imagery
==================================

As a government entity, NASA does not "license" the use of NASA
materials or sign license agreements. The Agency generally has no
objection to the reproduction and use of these materials (audio
transmissions and recordings; video transmissions and recording; or
still and motion picture photography), subject to the following
conditions:

* NASA material may not be used to state or imply the endorsement by
  NASA or by any NASA employee of a commercial product, service, or
  activity, or used in any manner that might mislead.

* NASA should be acknowledged as the source of the material.

* It is unlawful to falsely claim copyright or other rights in NASA
  material.

* NASA shall in no way be liable for any costs, expenses, claims, or
  demands arising out of the use of NASA material by a recipient or a
  recipient's distributees.

* NASA does not indemnify nor hold harmless users of NASA material,
  nor release such users from copyright infringement, nor grant
  exclusive use rights with respect to NASA material.

* NASA material is not protected by copyright unless noted. If
  copyrighted, permission should be obtained from the copyright owner
  prior to use. If not copyrighted, NASA material may be reproduced
  and distributed without further permission from NASA.

* If a recognizable person, or talent (e.g., an astronaut or a noted
  personality engaged to narrate a film) appears in NASA material, use
  for commercial purposes may infringe a right of privacy or
  publicity. Therefore, permission should be obtained from the
  recognizable person or talent. If the proposed use of the NASA
  material could be viewed as a commercial exploitation of that
  person. However, if the intended use of NASA material is primarily
  for communicative purposes, i.e., books, newspapers, and magazines
  reporting facts of historical significance (constitutionally
  protected media uses), then such uses will generally be considered
  not to infringe such personal rights.

* Some NASA audiovisual material may incorporate music or footage,
  which is copyrighted and licensed for the particular NASA work. Any
  editing or otherwise altering of the work may not be covered under
  the original license, and therefore would require permission of the
  copyright owner.

* NASA audiovisual material may include visible NASA identifiers
  (e.g., the name of the vehicle and the NASA Insignia or Logotype in
  photographs or film footage of Space Shuttle vehicles). Use of such
  materials is generally non-objectionable, provided the NASA
  identifiers appear in their factual context.
