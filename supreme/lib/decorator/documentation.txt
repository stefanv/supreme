Introduction
------------------------------------------------

Python 2.4 decorators are an interesting example of why syntactic sugar 
matters: in principle, their introduction changed nothing, since they do 
not provide any new functionality which was not already present in the
language; in practice, their introduction has significantly changed the way 
we structure our programs in Python. I believe the change is for the best, 
and that decorators are a great idea since:

* decorators help reducing boilerplate code;
* decorators help separation of concerns; 
* decorators enhance readability and maintenability;
* decorators are very explicit.

Still, as of now, writing custom decorators correctly requires
some experience and it is not as easy as it could be. For instance,
typical implementations of decorators involve nested functions, and
we all know that flat is better than nested.

The aim of the ``decorator`` module it to simplify the usage of 
decorators for the average programmer, and to popularize decorators
usage giving examples of useful decorators, such as ``memoize``,
``tracing``, ``redirecting_stdout``, ``locked``, etc.

The core of this module is a decorator factory called ``decorator``. 
All decorators discussed here are built as simple recipes on top 
of  ``decorator``. You may find their source code in the ``_main.py`` 
file, which is generated automatically when you run the doctester
(included into the decorator package) on this documentation::

  $ python doctester.py documentation.txt

At the same time the doctester runs all the examples contained here as 
test cases.

Definitions
------------------------------------

Technically speaking, any Python object which can be called with one argument
can be used as  a decorator. However, this definition is somewhat too large 
to be really useful. It is more convenient to split the generic class of 
decorators in two groups:

+ *signature-preserving* decorators, i.e. callable objects taking a
  function as input and returning a function *with the same
  signature* as output;

+ *signature-changing* decorators, i.e. decorators that change
  the signature of their input function, or decorators returning
  non-callable objects.

Signature-changing decorators have their use: for instance the
builtin classes ``staticmethod`` and ``classmethod`` are in this
group, since they take functions and return descriptor objects which 
are not functions, nor callables.

However, signature-preserving decorators are more common and easier to
reason about; in particular signature-preserving decorators can be
composed together whereas other
decorators in general cannot (for instance you cannot 
meaningfully compose a staticmethod with a classmethod or viceversa).

Writing signature-preserving decorators from scratch is not that
obvious, especially if one wants to define proper decorators that 
can accept functions with any signature. A simple example will clarify 
the issue.

Statement of the problem
------------------------------

Suppose you want to trace a function: this is a typical use case
for a decorator and you can find in many places code like this::

 #<_main.py>

 try:
     from functools import update_wrapper
 except ImportError: # using Python version < 2.5
     def decorator_trace(f):
         def newf(*args, **kw):
            print "calling %s with args %s, %s" % (f.__name__, args, kw)
            return f(*args, **kw)
         newf.__name__ = f.__name__
         newf.__dict__.update(f.__dict__)
         newf.__doc__ = f.__doc__
         newf.__module__ = f.__module__
         return newf
 else: # using Python 2.5+
     def decorator_trace(f):
         def newf(*args, **kw):
             print "calling %s with args %s, %s" % (f.__name__, args, kw)
             return f(*args, **kw)
         return update_wrapper(newf, f)

 #</_main.py>

The implementation above works in the sense that the decorator 
can accept functions with generic signatures; unfortunately this
implementation does *not* define a signature-preserving decorator, since in
general ``decorator_trace`` returns a function with a
*different signature* from the original function.

Consider for instance the following case:

>>> @decorator_trace
... def f1(x):
...     pass

Here the original function takes a single argument named ``x``,
but the decorated function takes any number of arguments and
keyword arguments:

>>> from inspect import getargspec 
>>> print getargspec(f1) 
([], 'args', 'kw', None)

This means that introspection tools such as pydoc will give
wrong informations about the signature of ``f1``. This is pretty bad:
pydoc will tell you that the function accepts a generic signature 
``*args``, ``**kw``, but when you try to call the function with more than an 
argument, you will get an error:

>>> f1(0, 1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
TypeError: f1() takes exactly 1 argument (2 given)

The solution
-----------------------------------------

The solution is to provide a generic factory of generators, which
hides the complexity of making signature-preserving decorators
from the application programmer. The ``decorator`` factory
allows to define decorators without the need to use nested functions 
or classes. As an example, here is how you can define
``decorator_trace``.

First of all, you must import ``decorator``:

>>> from decorator import decorator

Then you must define an helper function with signature ``(f, *args, **kw)``
which calls the original function ``f`` with arguments ``args`` and ``kw``
and implements the tracing capability::

 #<_main.py>

 def trace(f, *args, **kw):
     print "calling %s with args %s, %s" % (f.func_name, args, kw)
     return f(*args, **kw)

 #</_main.py>


``decorator`` is able to convert the helper function into a 
signature-preserving decorator 
object, i.e  is a callable object that takes a function and returns a 
decorated function with the same signature of the original function.
Therefore, you can write the following:
 
>>> @decorator(trace)
... def f1(x):
...     pass

It is immediate to verify that ``f1`` works

>>> f1(0)
calling f1 with args (0,), {}

and it that it has the correct signature:

>>> print getargspec(f1) 
(['x'], None, None, None)

The same decorator works with functions of any signature:

>>> @decorator(trace)
... def f(x, y=1, z=2, *args, **kw):
...     pass

>>> f(0, 3)
calling f with args (0, 3, 2), {}

>>> print getargspec(f) 
(['x', 'y', 'z'], 'args', 'kw', (1, 2))

That includes even functions with exotic signatures like the following:

>>> @decorator(trace)
... def exotic_signature((x, y)=(1,2)): return x+y

>>> print getargspec(exotic_signature)
([['x', 'y']], None, None, ((1, 2),))
>>> exotic_signature() 
calling exotic_signature with args ((1, 2),), {}
3


``decorator`` is a decorator
---------------------------------------------

The ``decorator`` factory itself can be considered as a signature-changing
decorator, just as ``classmethod`` and ``staticmethod``.
However, ``classmethod`` and ``staticmethod`` return generic
objects which are not callable, while ``decorator`` returns
signature-preserving decorators, i.e. functions of a single argument.
Therefore, you can write

>>> @decorator
... def tracing(f, *args, **kw):
...     print "calling %s with args %s, %s" % (f.func_name, args, kw)
...     return f(*args, **kw)

and this idiom is actually redefining ``tracing`` to be a decorator.
We can easily check that the signature has changed:

>>> print getargspec(tracing)
(['f'], None, None, None)

Therefore now ``tracing`` can be used as a decorator and
the following will work:

>>> @tracing
... def func(): pass

>>> func()
calling func with args (), {}

BTW, you may use the decorator on lambda functions too:

>>> tracing(lambda : None)()
calling <lambda> with args (), {}

For the rest of this document, I will discuss examples of useful
decorators built on top of ``decorator``.


``memoize``
---------------------------------------------------------

This decorator implements the ``memoize`` pattern, i.e. it caches
the result of a function in a dictionary, so that the next time
the function is called with the same input parameters the result is retrieved
from the cache and not recomputed.

::

 #<_main.py>
 
 from decorator import *

 def getattr_(obj, name, default_thunk):
     "Similar to .setdefault in dictionaries."
     try:
         return getattr(obj, name)
     except AttributeError: 
         default = default_thunk()
         setattr(obj, name, default)
         return default
    
 @decorator
 def memoize(func, *args):
     dic = getattr_(func, "memoize_dic", dict) 
     # memoize_dic is created at the first call
     if args in dic:
         return dic[args]
     else:
         result = func(*args)
         dic[args] = result
         return result
 
 #</_main.py>

Here is a test of usage:

>>> @memoize
... def heavy_computation():
...     time.sleep(2)
...     return "done"

>>> print heavy_computation() # the first time it will take 2 seconds
done

>>> print heavy_computation() # the second time it will be instantaneous
done

As an exercise, try to implement ``memoize`` *properly* without the
``decorator`` factory.

Notice that this ``memoize`` only works for functions with no keyword
arguments, since it is impossible to memoize correctly something that 
depends on mutable arguments. One can relax this requirement, and
allow keyword arguments in the signature: however, if keyword
arguments are passed, the result should not be cached. For an
example see http://www.python.org/moin/PythonDecoratorLibrary

``locked``
---------------------------------------------------------------

There are good use cases for decorators is in multithreaded programming.
For instance, a ``locked`` decorator can remove the boilerplate 
for acquiring/releasing locks [#]_.

::

 #<_main.py>

 import threading

 @decorator
 def locked(func, *args, **kw):
     lock = getattr_(func, "lock", threading.Lock)
     lock.acquire()
     try:
         result = func(*args, **kw)
     finally:
         lock.release()
     return result

 #</_main.py>

.. [#] In Python 2.5, the preferred way to manage locking is via 
       the ``with`` statement: http://docs.python.org/dev/lib/with-locks.html

To show an example of usage, suppose one wants to write some data to
an external resource which can be accessed by a single user at once
(for instance a printer). Then the access to the writing function must 
be locked::

 #<_main.py>

 import time

 datalist = [] # for simplicity the written data are stored into a list.

 @locked
 def write(data):
     "Writing to a sigle-access resource"
     time.sleep(1)
     datalist.append(data)

 #</_main.py>

Since the writing function is locked, we are guaranteed that at any given time 
there is at most one writer. An example multithreaded program that invokes
``write`` and prints the datalist is shown in the next section.

``delayed`` and ``threaded``
--------------------------------------------

Often, one wants to define families of decorators, i.e. decorators depending
on one or more parameters. 

Here I will consider the example of a one-parameter family of ``delayed`` 
decorators taking a procedure and converting it into a delayed procedure. 
In this case the time delay is the parameter. 

A delayed procedure is a procedure that, when called, 
is executed in a separate thread after a certain time 
delay. The implementation is not difficult::

 #<_main.py>

 def delayed(nsec):
     def call(proc, *args, **kw):
         thread = threading.Timer(nsec, proc, args, kw)
         thread.start()
         return thread
     return decorator(call)

 #</_main.py>

Notice that without the help of ``decorator``, an additional level of 
nesting would have been needed.

Delayed decorators as intended to be used on procedures, i.e.
on functions returning ``None``, since the return value of the original 
function is discarded by this implementation. The decorated function returns 
the current execution thread, which can be stored and checked later, for 
instance to verify that the thread ``.isAlive()``.

Delayed procedures can be useful in many situations. For instance, I have used 
this pattern to start a web browser *after* the web server started, 
in code such as

>>> @delayed(2)
... def start_browser():
...     "code to open an external browser window here"

>>> #start_browser() # will open the browser in 2 seconds
>>> #server.serve_forever() # enter the server mainloop

The particular case in which there is no delay is important enough
to deserve a name::

 #<_main.py>

 threaded = delayed(0) # no-delay decorator

 #</_main.py>

Threaded procedures will be executed in a separated thread as soon
as they are called. Here is an example using the ``write``
routine defined before:

>>> @threaded
... def writedata(data):
...     write(data)

Each call to ``writedata`` will create a new writer thread, but there will 
be no synchronization problems since ``write`` is locked.

>>> writedata("data1") 
<_Timer(Thread-1, started)>

>>> time.sleep(.1) # wait a bit, so we are sure data2 is written after data1

>>> writedata("data2") 
<_Timer(Thread-2, started)>

>>> time.sleep(2) # wait for the writers to complete

>>> print datalist
['data1', 'data2']

``blocking``
-------------------------------------------

Sometimes one has to deal with blocking resources, such as ``stdin``, and
sometimes it is best to have back a "busy" message than to block everything. 
This behavior can be implemented with a suitable decorator::

 #<_main.py>

 def blocking(not_avail="Not Available"):
     def call(f, *args, **kw):
         if not hasattr(f, "thread"): # no thread running
             def set_result(): f.result = f(*args, **kw)
             f.thread = threading.Thread(None, set_result)
             f.thread.start()
             return not_avail
         elif f.thread.isAlive():
             return not_avail
         else: # the thread is ended, return the stored result
             del f.thread 
             return f.result
     return decorator(call)
         
 #</_main.py>
   
Functions decorated with ``blocking`` will return a busy message if
the resource is unavailable, and the intended result if the resource is 
available. For instance:

>>> @blocking("Please wait ...")
... def read_data():
...     time.sleep(3) # simulate a blocking resource
...     return "some data"

>>> print read_data() # data is not available yet
Please wait ...

>>> time.sleep(1)  
>>> print read_data() # data is not available yet
Please wait ...

>>> time.sleep(1)
>>> print read_data() # data is not available yet
Please wait ...

>>> time.sleep(1.1) # after 3.1 seconds, data is available
>>> print read_data()
some data

``redirecting_stdout``
-------------------------------------------

Decorators help in removing the boilerplate associated to ``try .. finally``
blocks. We saw the case of ``locked``; here is another example::

 #<_main.py>

 import sys

 def redirecting_stdout(new_stdout):
     def call(func, *args, **kw):
         save_stdout = sys.stdout
         sys.stdout = new_stdout
         try:
             result = func(*args, **kw)
         finally:
             sys.stdout = save_stdout
         return result
     return decorator(call)

 #</_main.py>

Here is an example of usage:

>>> from StringIO import StringIO

>>> out = StringIO()

>>> @redirecting_stdout(out)
... def helloworld():
...     print "hello, world!"

>>> helloworld()

>>> out.getvalue()
'hello, world!\n'


Similar tricks can be used to remove the boilerplate associate with
transactional databases. I think you got the idea, so I will leave
the transactional example as an exercise for the reader. Of course
in Python 2.5 these use cases can also be addressed with the ``with``
statement.

``tail_recursive``
------------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes, you may find on the net cool decorators that you would
like to include in your code. However, it is likely these decorators 
have not been written using ``decorator`` and that they are not
signature-preserving. So, you need an easy way to convert
third party decorators in signature-preserving decorators without
having to rewrite them in terms of ``decorator``. Luckily, the
``decorator`` module provides a convenience function ``update_wrapper``
which can be used for this purpose. By default, ``update_wrapper`` 
mimic the behavior of ``functools.update_wrapper`` which has been 
added to the standard library in Python 2.5 (i.e. it just copies the
function attributes ``__name__``, ``__doc__``, ``__dict__`` and 
``__module__``), but is has the additional power to copy the signature, 
simply by setting the flag ``create=True``.

For instance, suppose you have a function ``func``
with a "permissive" signature (say ``func(*args, **kw)``, returned by the
third party non signature-preserving decorator) and another
function ``model`` which has a stricter signature; then 
``update_wrapper(func, model, create=True)`` 
returns a copy of ``func`` with signature copied from ``model``. Notice that 
it is your responsability to make sure that the original function and the model
function have compatibile signature, i.e. that the signature of
the model is stricter (or equivalent) than the signature of the
original function. If not, you will get an error at function calling
time.

In order to give an example of usage for ``update_wrapper``, I will show a 
pretty slick decorator that converts a tail-recursive function in an iterative
function. I have shamelessly stolen the basic idea from Kay Schluehr's recipe
in the Python Cookbook, 
http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/496691.

::
    
    #<_main.py>

    from decorator import update_wrapper

    class TailRecursive(object):
        """
        tail_recursive decorator based on Kay Schluehr's recipe
        http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/496691
        """
        CONTINUE = object() # sentinel
        
        def __init__(self, func):
            self.func = func
            self.firstcall = True
    
        def __call__(self, *args, **kwd):
            try:
                if self.firstcall: # start looping
                    self.firstcall = False
                    while True:            
                        result = self.func(*args, **kwd)
                        if result is self.CONTINUE: # update arguments
                            args, kwd = self.argskwd
                        else: # last call
                            break
                else: # return the arguments of the tail call
                    self.argskwd = args, kwd
                    return self.CONTINUE
            except: # reset and re-raise
                self.firstcall = True
                raise
            else: # reset and exit
                self.firstcall = True 
                return result
    
    def tail_recursive(func):
        "Convert TailRecursive into a signature-preserving decorator"
        return update_wrapper(TailRecursive(func), func, create=True) 
    
    #</_main.py>

Here is how you apply the decorator to the good old factorial::
 
    #<_main.py>

    @tail_recursive
    def factorial(n, acc=1):
        "The good old factorial"
        if n == 0: return acc
        return factorial(n-1, n*acc)

    #</_main.py>
 

>>> print factorial(4) 
24

This decorator is pretty impressive, and should give you some food for
your mind ;) Notice that there is no recursion limit now, and you can 
easily compute ``factorial(1001)`` or larger without filling the stack
frame. Notice also that the decorator will not work on functions which
are not tail recursive, such as

::

    def fact(n): # this is not tail-recursive
        if n == 0: return 1
        return n * fact(n-1)

(a function is tail recursive if it either returns a value without
making a recursive call, or returns directly the result of a recursive
call).

Caveats and limitations
-------------------------------------------

You should be aware that decorators have a performance penalty. 
The worse case is shown by the following example::

 $ cat performance.sh
 python -m timeit -s "
 from decorator import decorator

 @decorator
 def do_nothing(func, *args, **kw):
     return func(*args, **kw) 

 @do_nothing
 def f():
     pass
 " "f()"

 python -m timeit -s "
 def f():
     pass
 " "f()"

On my Linux system, using the ``do_nothing`` decorator instead of the
plain function is more than four times slower::

 $ bash performance.sh 
 1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.68 usec per loop
 1000000 loops, best of 3: 0.397 usec per loop

It should be noted that a real life function would probably do 
something more useful than ``f`` here, and therefore in real life the
performance penalty could be completely negligible.  As always, the
only way to know if there is 
a penalty in your specific use case is to measure it.

You should be aware that decorators will make your tracebacks
longer and more difficult to understand. Consider this example:

>>> @tracing
... def f():
...     1/0

Calling ``f()`` will give you a ``ZeroDivisionError``, but since the
function is decorated the traceback will be longer:

>>> f()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
    f()
  File "<string>", line 2, in f
  File "<stdin>", line 4, in tracing
    return f(*args, **kw)
  File "<stdin>", line 3, in f
    1/0
ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero

You see here the inner call to the decorator ``tracing``, which calls 
``f(*args, **kw)``, and a reference to  ``File "<string>", line 2, in f``. 
This latter reference is due to the fact that internally the decorator
module uses ``eval`` to generate the decorated function. Notice that
``eval`` is *not* responsibile for the performance penalty, since is the
called *only once* at function decoration time, and not every time
the decorated function is called.

At present, there is no way to avoid ``eval``. A clean solution
would require to change the CPython implementation of functions and
add an hook to make it possible to change their signature directly. 
This may happen in future versions of Python and then this module
would become obsolete.

For debugging purposes, it may be useful to know that the decorator
module also provides a ``getinfo`` utility function which returns a 
dictionary containing information about a function.
For instance, for the factorial function we will get

>>> d = getinfo(factorial)
>>> d['name']
'factorial'
>>> d['argnames']
['n', 'acc']
>>> d['signature']
'n, acc'
>>> d['defaults']
(1,)
>>> d['doc']
'The good old factorial'

In the present implementation, decorators generated by ``decorator``
can only be used on user-defined Python functions or methods, not on generic 
callable objects, nor on built-in functions, due to limitations of the
``inspect`` module in the standard library.
Also, there is a restriction on the names of the arguments: if try to
call an argument ``_call_`` or ``_func_`` you will get an AssertionError:

>>> @tracing
... def f(_func_): print f
... 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
AssertionError: You cannot use _call_ or _func_ as argument names!

(the existence of these two reserved names is an implementation detail).

Moreover, the implementation is such that the decorated function contais
a copy of the original function attributes:

>>> def f(): pass # the original function
>>> f.attr1 = "something" # setting an attribute
>>> f.attr2 = "something else" # setting another attribute

>>> traced_f = tracing(f) # the decorated function

>>> traced_f.attr1
'something'
>>> traced_f.attr2 = "something different" # setting attr
>>> f.attr2 # the original attribute did not change
'something else'


That's all folks, enjoy!
